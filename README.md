This provides the results for $TTSCA_{big}$ and when applied on ASCADv1 and AES_HD_ext.<br>
TTDCNN_3 is the $TTSCA_{big}$ with no padding.<br>
TTDCNN_2 is the miniature $TTSCA_{big}$ with padding 25.<br> 
TTDCNN_ASCAD_rand_2 is $TTSCA_{big}$ with kernel size 75 for Conv1D_1 and average pooling of kernel size 75 and stride 150.
TTDCNN_ASCAD_rand_2 is used on ASCADv1\_r
